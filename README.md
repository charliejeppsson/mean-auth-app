Tunebook is a very simple RESTful web app, and also my first project working with the MEAN stack. The app allows the user to create a personal account, log in, search through Spotify's database of artists, albums and tracks, get a preview listen to any track, and play the full track on Spotify's Web Player... That's it!

The development roadmap included:

setting up a development environment with MongoDB, Express, Angular2, and Node,
designing and implementing a system architecture with 5+ routes,
designing and implementing a NoSQL database using Mongoose, MongoDB, and mLab/AWS,
setting up user authentication for login with Passport and JSON Web Tokens (JWT),
setting up user authorization for profile and dashboard routes with the angular2-jwt module,
integrating with the Spotify API,
designing 8 components and 3 services with Angular2, as well as integrating front-end with back-end,
front-end design with Bootstrap and Sketch,
making the app mobile-responsive with Bootstrap and FlexBox,
deploying the app with Heroku.
