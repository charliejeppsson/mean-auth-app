<h1>Tunebook - Your one-stop-shop for discovering new music</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Tunebook is a very simple RESTful web app, and also my first project working with the MEAN stack. The app allows the user to create a personal account, log in, search through Spotify's database of artists, albums and tracks, get a preview listen to any track, and play the full track on Spotify's Web Player... That's it!
